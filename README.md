## What is this repo all about?

This repo is about the task i was able to accomplish while I was learning to code. This repo may be filled up with a few lines of code but it cost me lots of research, dedication  and time.



## Why are you learning these skills?

i learned these skills because Data is valuable. With so much sensitive information online, companies need cybersecurity pros to protect it. This course is a great starting point for anyone interested in cybersecurity, but not sure where to start. Build your foundation by learning the fundamentals of one of the fastest-growing fields today.

The fundamental concept of 201 is to learn about coding where i figure out different aspects of code, like , strings, objects, arrays, boolean, integers and functions. Ops 201 is about basic knowledge of  foundation of an operating system, where it helps to gain key skills such as communication, knowledge and process documentation, fundamental terminal operations, performance monitoring, system process management, issue handling, backup/imaging/recovery tools, and software application operations are developed.



## What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

Coding in general has been fun for me,  where i learn to improve my logical thinking skills by allowing me to see problems from a new perspective and  by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking,



## How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

Shell scripts can be  used as part of  automation tools to support a few functionalities. We can transfer the shell script to other UNIX and similar operating systems and execute. Shell scripts are also used to monitor systems regularly.



## What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

I would like to improve and learn more about bash scripting because it is a useful tool for a developer to utilize in increasing productivity and managing menial, repetitive tasks.



## What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

i would still like to master a basic script of shell scripting before i look into Scripting executing, loops, scripting parameters.
